Internship Success Analytics Insights with Power BI Excel



PROJECT OVERVIEW.

This analysis focuses on internship completion rates, leveraging Power BI and Excel to uncover key factors influencing success. It explores variables such as mentor involvement, internship length, and departmental trends, aiming to provide actionable insights to enhance internship program effectiveness.



DATASET OVERVIEW.

The dataset used contains the following columns:

-- Intern ID: Unique identifier for each intern.

-- Enrollment Date: The start date of the internship.

-- Completion Status: Indicates if the internship was Completed, Dropped Out, or is In Progress.

-- Dropout Reason: If applicable, the reason for dropout.

-- Department: Department assigned to the intern.

-- Internship Duration: Length of the internship in weeks.

-- Mentor Interaction: Frequency of mentor interactions (Weekly, Biweekly, None).

-- Performance Score: Optional metric to evaluate intern performance.

TOOLS UTILIZED

-- Microsoft Excel: Data cleaning, PivotTables, and statistical analysis.

-- Power BI: Data visualization and interactive dashboard creation.



OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT

-- Investigate how internship enrollment varies over time.

-- Assess completion rates across different departments.

-- Analyze the relationship between mentor interaction frequency and internship success.

-- Determine how internship duration influences intern performance.

-- Visualize the data through Power BI dashboards to enhance interpretation.

DATA PROCESSING STEPS

-- Data Cleaning: Identified and handled missing values, corrected inconsistencies, and standardized date formats.

-- Data Transformation: Converted categorical completion status into numeric values (Completed = 1, Dropped Out = 0).

Statistical Analysis:

-- Enrollment Trends: Counted interns per department.

Completion Rates: Calculated the percentage of completed internships.

-- Mentor Interaction Impact: Compared completion rates based on mentor interaction frequency.

-- Duration vs Performance: Analyzed the correlation between internship length and intern performance.



VISUALIZALIZATIONS IN POWER BI

Bar Chart: Shows completion rates by department.

Line Graph: Illustrates internship enrollment trends over time.

Heatmap: Displays the relationship between mentor interaction frequency, internship duration, and completion rates.



STEPS TO RUN THE PROJECT.

Power BI:

Load the dataset (internship_data.xlsx).

Create relationships (linking internship duration with completion status).

Design visualizations using bar charts, line graphs, and heatmaps.

Organize the dashboard for clarity and export visuals as needed.

Excel:

Open the dataset and apply PivotTables for department-specific analysis.

Perform basic statistical calculations such as completion rates.

Use conditional formatting to highlight key trends.
